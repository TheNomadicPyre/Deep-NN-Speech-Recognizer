# Deep-NN-Speech-Recognizer
This is a Deep NN Speech Recognizer project built as a capstone for Udacity's Natural Language Processing Nanodegree.
This project takes as an input either a spectrogram or a MFCC.

This contains 5 different architectures:
A simple RNN; a RNN with batch normalization, TimeDistributed and a softmax activation; a CNN model; a deep RNN model; and a bidirectional rnn model.
